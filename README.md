## Pitch
In small gatherings, parties, or public spaces, there’s often a single device playing music and many people who want to suggest songs to play. We would like to create a web-based application which allows users to queue songs from their own devices, contributing to a “collaborative playlist” among all users in the same physical area. In this way, people could add their favorite songs to this queue, upvote songs that they want to hear, and see a ranked queue of songs which will be played next (in order of popularity by the vote). Users should be able to add songs to the playlist simply by name, without any requirement that they have a personal Spotify account.
